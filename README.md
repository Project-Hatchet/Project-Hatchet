# **Project Hatchet**

## **Well established Arma 3 open source project looking to expand**

- The Hatchet Project has been in development since 2018 and nearing completion of our current project. We are looking to expand and tackle multiple tasks simultaneously.  The mod is currently in the beta phase of development and has 14,678 Current Subscribers. Yax of the previous lead developers mod the **FA-18 Super Hornet has 135,485 Current Subscribers**. PUBG standalone game was a mod that was original created for Arma 3, and the 2019 PUBG Mobile standalone game Surges **Past $1.5 Billion in Gross Revenue**. 

- Do you want to dip your feet and see if Game Development is for you?  Give our daily dev stream a watch and decide if you will be a good fit for the team; beginners to seasoned developers are welcomed. This is where the rubber meets the road, writing documentation, source control, detailed strategic sort, and long term planning, using multiple texturing programs, programming in various languages, creating development tools.  Project management at all levels all meet in one place, and the stress and frustration that comes with it. 

- 3d Modeling is a challenging profession; executing that talent for a game has increased complexity with multiple LODS, game engine limitations and unforeseen complication, difficult design choices, whether performance or fidelity matter more will need to be made a complex environment. Let alone working with programmers' designers and beta testers about the end state chasing an evolving endstate.
Our short-term strategy is to create 5 of the most realistic and interactive and aircraft available in Arma. We plan on delivering our assets no later than 15FEB22 with the support of at least ten additional developers. Our long-term plan uses the high quality of work and name of hatchet studio to acquire contracts for DLC's for Digital flight simulator (DCS) or FS2020 and other AAA games for aircraft development. 

- When the Studio receives requests for paid contracts for development work for DLC's, the company will switch to a business profit share model. Currently, this is only a passion project to establish industry creditability for the Studio
